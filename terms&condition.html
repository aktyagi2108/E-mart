	<center><h3>Terms and Conditions</h3></center>
	<p><h4>1. Information accuracy</h4>
If you are running an ecommerce site with a lot of product pages, it can be a full-time job making sure that all the information is accurate. It’s one of the most likely errors that will occur in your online store, so it opens the door to a lot of customer service issues. For this reason, it’s very important that you stipulate that information can sometimes be inaccurate and change without notice.</p>
<p><h4>2. Terms of sale</h4>
This part of your T&C should set out clear terms on how products can be purchased, whether there are any restrictions e.g. the restriction of sale for age-restricted products and services, and what happens in the event that a product cannot be supplied.

HBO’s ecommerce T&C outlines this quite well. Its “Terms of Sale” section mentions that by placing orders on the site, the customers represent that they are of legal age and that the information they provide is true and accurate. The terms also mention that HBO takes steps to verify customer information prior to accepting and order and that the company has the right to accept, modify, or decline orders.</p>
<p><h4>3. Payment terms</h4>
This is where you will cover any terms relating to the payment of the product/service you sell. This is one of the biggest areas of liability for your business, so you need to make sure that your customers understand the expectations surrounding online transactions.

The payment terms section of your site should include:

The payment methods you accept (Visa, Mastercard etc.)
Missed/late payment conditions
How you will handle refunds/returns
How you will handle payment disputes
Because they are an intermediary between the buyer and seller, Etsy has very comprehensive T&C for its site. It establishes the rights and responsibilities of both the buyer and the seller. It also states that in agreeing to their T&C, the customer is also agreeing to the T&C of third-party services such as PayPal as well.</p>
<p><h4>4. Shipping & delivery</h4>
This is an area that has a lot of potential for error in ecommerce. A delivery could get delayed, damaged in transit — or not arrive at all. This is especially important if you use a 3PL provider or freight company. This is because your business no longer has direct control over what happens to orders. But the buck stops with you, as far as your customer is concerned. Although this is important for any seller, it has particular relevance to those who sell products that are more logistically difficult to fulfill.

That’s why it’s essential to outline your shipping and delivery terms, in which your discuss the amount of time it takes to fulfill orders, how costs are calculated and whether extra fees are applicable, and what your level of responsibility includes when third parties are involved.

If we go onto IKEA’s Terms and Conditions, we can see that they have laid a specific page just for delivery and shipping information:</p>
<p><h4>5. Intellectual property</h4>
As an online business, you are more likely to be vulnerable to intellectual property theft in the form of your logo, business name or site theme. For this reason, you need to protect your intellectual property within your T&C by stating your ownership over such features.

An intellectual property clause should act to ensure that brands or trademarks are not misused in any way and clearly state that nothing contained within the website should be construed as granting any license or the right to use any trademark without the prior written consent of the owner of the website.</p>

<p><h4>6. Disclaimer of liability</h4>Things don’t always go according to plan. Product losses, damages, injuries can occur. As such, your T&C should specify the damages that one party e.g. ecommerce store owner, will be obligated to provide to the other e.g. customer, in the event of product failure and should reflect the level of risk involved.

It will also specify what the ecommerce store owner will not be responsible for in the event of any loss, liability, damage (whether direct, indirect or consequential), personal injury or expense of any nature whatsoever which may be suffered by the customer.</p>
<p><h4>7. Loyalty programs and promotions</h4>Consider including provisions around your promotional deals or loyalty programs. Below is an example from cosmetics retailer Sephora:</p>
